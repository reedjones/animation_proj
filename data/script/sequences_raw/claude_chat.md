Got it, here's a storyboard/timeline breakdown of the screenplay with brief scene descriptions, character notes, and visual aesthetic/style notes:

Disheveled Apartment
Black teenager and flamboyant rapper-like man having a surreal conversation
Visuals: Surreal atmosphere, morphing objects, fractal folding of space
Aesthetic: Psychedelic, unsettling, mind-bending

Lush Jungle
Protagonist navigating through dense jungle, pursued by unseen force
Ancient civilizations, mystical phenomena hinting at interconnectedness
Visuals: Roots/leaves growing, man with spear, feminine face forming in forest
Aesthetic: Mystical, primal, metaphysical undertones

Modern Bedroom to City Street
Teenager wakes up, heads into city - aloof and disconnected
Feminine face forming on wall (hallucination), then hit by bus
Visuals: Busy cityscape blurring, fast-paced, paramedics/onlookers
Aesthetic: Urban, detached, mechanical indifference

Tunnel of Light
Tunnel in space with stream of souls, feminine face forming
Teenager moves towards face, away from soul stream
Face shows on tunnel wall, teen touches wall revealing concrete underneath
Visuals: Cosmic tunnel, ethereal face, concrete beneath film layer
Aesthetic: Metaphysical, existential, revelation/choice


The overall aesthetic seems to blend surreal, psychedelic, and metaphysical visuals with grounded urban and natural settings. There's an underlying theme of interconnectedness between different planes of existence. Let me know if you need any clarification or have additional notes!

Sequence 1: Disheveled Apartment
A) Establishing the surreal apartment setting with teenager and flamboyant man
B) Conversation getting trippy, reality distorting with fractal folds

C) Cliff-hanger of man's voice distorting, referencing "the tunnel"

Sequence 2: Lush Jungle

Sequence 2:
"A dense, lush jungle setting where the same protagonist from the previous surreal apartment scene navigates through thick foliage, being pursued by some unseen force. Roots and leaves sprout as his feet disturb the jungle floor."

"Continuing from the previous frame in the lush jungle, the protagonist encounters signs of ancient civilizations and mystical phenomena hinting at the interconnectedness of past and present as he moves deeper into the foliage."

"The large feminine face first seen briefly in the modern city now forms within the jungle foliage, ethereal yet haunting, silently watching over the protagonist as he journeys through the depths of the jungle setting."

Sequence 3:
"The same black teenager from the previous surreal scenes wakes up in a modern bedroom, seeming aloof and disconnected as he gets up from the bed and heads out into the world."

"Now in a busy city street, the disconnected teenager walks through crowds, surroundings blurring and moving quickly. The haunting feminine face from the jungle scene briefly forms on a wall before dissipating as the teenager brushes it off."

"The teenager lies on the ground after being struck by a bus while crossing the same city street, a crowd gathering around him as paramedics rush to the scene. The indifferent city continues its mechanical march."

Sequence 4:
"A cosmic tunnel of brilliant light surrounded by stars in deep space. A stream of human souls mindlessly flows into the tunnel's light, including souls of the crowd from the previous city scene."

"The same teenager moves away from the stream of souls toward the forming feminine face seen previously, now outside the cosmic tunnel. Her expression shifts between curiosity and seriousness as she observes him."

"The feminine face positions herself on the semi-transparent tunnel wall. When the teenager touches the wall, a ripple effect reveals the same concrete from the modern city underneath the ethereal film layer. After a moment's realization, he darts out of the tunnel into the cosmic blackness."





You make an excellent point. To ensure cohesion across the video sequence, the prompts need to build upon and maintain continuity from the previous frames/prompts in terms of characters, settings, objects, etc.

Here's how I would modify the prompts for better coherence:
